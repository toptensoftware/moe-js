# Welcome to Moe-js

"Moe-js" is a simple, fast, flexible, modern, async enabled, Mustache/Handlebars inspired templating engine for JavaScript.

* Mustache/Handlebars inspired format
* Support for in-template JavaScript expressions
* Support for embedded code blocks
* Support for external helper functions
* Support for partials
* Support for async templates (use await inside template)
* Built-in Express integration including support for outer "layouts"
* Built-in template file cache
* Simple to use
* No dependencies

## Motivation

The primary goal behind Moe-js was to build a templating language with similar style to 
Mustache/Handlebars but with ability to use Javascript directly in templates.

Unlike Mustache/Handlebars which is language agnostic, Moe-js is deliberately and closely tied to 
the JavaScript language (which is why it has "js" in it's name).

Moe-js doesn't claim to be compatible with Mustache/Handlebars but the syntax is very similar
and existing templates can be converted fairly easily (certainly more easily than switching 
to a completely different view engine).
