# Partials

Partials let you embed the contents of another template inside this template.

For example, this will invoke the "UserDetails" template, passing the current model as the model for the template.

```html
{{> "UserDetails" }}
```

Note that unlike Mustache/Handlebars, the name of the partial template must be quoted because it's a JavaScript expression - which 
also means you can dynamically synthesize the name of the partial to invoke:

```html
{{> "UserDetails_" + model.role }}
```

When invoking a partial from within an `{{#each}}` block, the current loop item is passed as the partial's model. In this
example, the current user would be passed as the model to the partial template:

```html
{{#each u in model.Users}}
{{> "UserDetails" }}
{{/each}}
```

You can also, pass an explicit object to the partial template:

```html
{{> "UserDetails", model.user}}
```
