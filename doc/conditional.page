# Conditional Execution


The `{{#if}}` / `{{#else}}` / `{{/if}}` directives are used to conditionally include sections:

```html
{{#if model.quantity == 0}}
<p>OUT OF STOCK</p>
{{/if}}
```

Else blocks can be marked as `{{#else}}` or `{{else}}` (for Handlebars compatibility)

```html
{{#if model.quantity == 0}}
<p>OUT OF STOCK</p>
{{#else}}
<P>IN STOCK</P>
{{/if}}
```

There's also an `{{#elseif}}` directive:

```html
{{#if model.quantity == 0}}
<p>OUT OF STOCK</p>
{{#elseif model.quantity < 3}}
<p>ALMOST OUT OF STOCK</p>
{{#else}}
<P>IN STOCK</P>
{{/if}}
```

As an alternative for `{{#else}}` and `{{#elseif}}` you can use `{{^}}` and `{{^if}}`:

```html
{{#if model.quantity == 0}}
<p>OUT OF STOCK</p>
{{^if model.quantity < 3}}
<p>ALMOST OUT OF STOCK</p>
{{^}}
<P>IN STOCK</P>
{{/if}}
```

Moe-js doesn't really need an `{{#unless}}` block (because it's easy to just use `{{#if !(expr)}}`) but
includes one anyway:

```html
{{#unless model.newUser}}
<p>User ID: {{model.user.id}}</p>
{{/unless}}
```

An `{{#unless}}` block can't have an `{{#else}}` block.
