# API Basics

When you import moe-js, the returned object is the default instance of the MoeEngine class.  

```javascript
const moe = require('moe-js');
```

Although rarely necessary, you can create additional MoeEngine instances as follows:

```javascript
const moe = require('moe-js');
const moe2 = new moe.MoeEngine();
```
