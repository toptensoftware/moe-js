# Security Considerations

Since Moe.JS allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code it should only be used in situations where
the template scripts come from a trusted origin.

You should never allow an end user to upload a Moe.JS template and then execute it on your server.

eg: Suppose you're developing mailing list software, you shouldn't use Moe.JS as the template format
for email templates.

While Moe.JS provides a reasonably sandboxed environment that doesn't allow access to the file system, 
databases etc..., it's by no means secure and doesn't provide protection from attacks or accidental end
user mistakes such as infinite loop, stack overflows, allocating excessive memeory etc...
