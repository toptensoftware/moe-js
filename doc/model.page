title: The Model Variable
---
# The model Variable 

Data passed to the template is available as the special `model` variable inside the template:

eg: Suppose the template was invoked like so:

```javascript
template({ title: "This is the title" });
```

Inside the template, the model properties would be accessed as follows:

```html
<h1>{{model.title}}</h1>
```

(Unlike Handlebars, `{{title}}` won't work, you must specify `{{model.title}}`)
