# Escaping Braces

Moe-js doesn't provide any support for escaping braces outside of directives.  Instead, just use a simple
expression:

```html
{{"{{"}} This is double braced }}
```

Produces:

```html
{{ This is double braced }}
```

Single braces don't usually need to be escaped, unless they're immediately before a Moe-js directive:

```html
{{"{"}}{{model.title}}{{"}"}}
```

Produces:

```html
{TheTitle}
```

alternatively your could include spaces to separate the braces and then use `~` to strip it out:

```html
{ {{~model.title~}} }
```
