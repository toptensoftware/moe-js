# Welcome to Moe-js

"Moe-js" is a simple, fast, flexible, modern, async enabled, Handlebars inspired templating engine for JavaScript.

* Mustache/Handlebars inspired format
* Support for in-template JavaScript expressions
* Support for embedded code blocks
* Support for external helper functions
* Support for partials
* Support for async templates (use await inside template)
* Built-in Express integration including support for outer "layouts"
* Built-in template file cache
* Simple to use
* No dependencies

## Motivation

Moe-js was born out of desire to get around some of the limitations of Handlebars, while still 
providing a similar template syntax.  In particular, Moe-js is intended to address Handlebars'
awkward helper methods and the lack of support for even simple expressions within the template. 
Moe-js provides a way to "power-up" an existing set of Handlebars templates without having to 
rewrite them from scratch.

With Moe-js, you get a similar syntax but all the power of JavaScript within the template.  Unlike
Handlebars which is language agnostic, Moe-js is closely tied to the JavaScript language (which is 
why it has "js" in it's name).

Moe-js doesn't claim to be compatible with Handlebars but the syntax is very similar and existing
templates can be converted fairly easily (certainly more easily than switching to a completely 
different view engine).
